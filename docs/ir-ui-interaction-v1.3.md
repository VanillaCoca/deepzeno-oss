# ZENO V1 — IR UI/UX Interaction Spec (v1.3)

**Owners:**
- Sean (product + frontend implementation review)
- Codex (component implementation, state management)

**Status:** Draft v1.3
**Last updated:** 2026-05-07
**Replaces (in part):** v1.2 §5.4 (Truth Zone) and §4 (Detail pane relations area). v1.2 sections §1–§3, §5.1–§5.3, §6–§9 remain authoritative — this doc does **not** redefine inline refs, Ideas zone, Candidates zone, reactivation anchor, /save flow, or the 4-zone right-panel scaffolding.

**Companion docs:**
- `ir-extraction.md` v1.3 — data layer
- `ir-ui-interaction (1).md` v1.2 — every section this doc does not override
- `prompts/ir-edge-contract.md` (deleted) → see `lib/ir/sweep.ts` `buildSweepSystemPrompt` for the live sweep prompt; the 6-relation enum is enforced at DB level in `supabase/migrations/20260502000001_ir_nodes_and_edges.sql`

---

## 0. What changed from v1.2

| topic | v1.2 | v1.3 |
|---|---|---|
| Truth Zone default view | By Type (kind buckets) | **By Relation (DAG tree)** |
| Truth Zone visual style | flat list per kind, color pill + abbrev | indented DAG tree, char-based glyphs |
| kind disambiguation | colored pill in row | unicode glyph + 3-letter code at row start |
| status disambiguation | dot color | unicode char at row head (color-blind safe) |
| edge type visualization | not rendered in main tree | character on connector, hover for label |
| multi-parent IRs | duplicated independently | rendered once under primary parent + `↑N` shadow markers under secondary parents |
| DAG roots | only `goal` was a root | any node with no incoming relation edges is a root (free principles, free constraints, etc.) |
| Detail pane relations | flat list of all edges | 4 grouped sections: Children / Parents / Co-resolved / Conflicts |

The legacy By Type view is **kept** as a secondary mode (§7), accessible via the view-mode toggle. Zero data churn — same `ir_nodes` + `ir_edges` rows render in either mode.

---

## 1. Core principles for the tree

```
1. Structure information lives in CHARACTERS, not in colors.
   Anyone who copy-pastes a tree row into Slack/email must lose nothing.
   Color is decorative; chars are load-bearing.

2. Density beats decoration. Row height 24px. No card backgrounds. No
   pills, no borders between rows. Indentation guides at 0.3 alpha.

3. Multi-parent IRs render ONCE in their primary location, with `↑N`
   shadows in secondary locations. Never duplicate full content.

4. Edges have types and directions. The tree shows BOTH visually:
   - parent kind glyph at row start
   - relation glyph on the connector before each child
   This is non-negotiable — without it, the tree is just a list
   with extra whitespace, which is the v1.2 problem.

5. Click any glyph or connector to filter or inspect. The tree is a
   graph viewer, not just an outline.

6. The Detail pane is the universal display surface (per v1.2 §4).
   v1.3 only refines its relations area (§6).
```

## 2. Visual scheme

### 2.1 Status characters (row head, 1 char)

| status | char | rendering | hidden by default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `active` | `●` | full opacity | no |
| `pending` | `○` | full opacity | no |
| `idea` | `◐` | 70% opacity | no |
| `superseded` | `⊘` | strikethrough text, 50% opacity | yes (toggle in `[⚙]`) |
| `dismissed` | — | not rendered | yes (toggle in `[⚙]`) |

The status char sits at the very start of a node row, in monospace, with a single space after it. Color may be used as **secondary** reinforcement (e.g. `idea` slightly desaturated) but the char is the source of truth.

### 2.2 Kind glyphs + 3-letter codes

| kind | glyph | code | color hint (optional) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `goal` | `◆` | `goal` | green-dim |
| `plan/decision` | `▣` | `dec` | blue-dim |
| `plan/task` | `☐` | `task` | blue-dim |
| `plan/milestone` | `▲` | `mst` | blue-dim |
| `constraint` | `▮` | `cstr` | amber-dim |
| `principle` | `§` | `prn` | teal-dim |
| `hypothesis` | `◌` | `hyp` | purple-dim |
| `open_question` | `?` | `q` | yellow-dim |
| `rejection` | `⊘` | `rej` | red-dim (distinct from superseded by row context) |
| `unclassified` | `·` | `?` | gray |

Row format (monospace, single line):

```
{status} {kind_glyph} {code:4}  {short_id:4}  {title}        {trailing_meta}
```

- `code` left-padded to 4 chars (`dec ` / `task` / `cstr` / `prn ` / `q   ` / `goal` / `mst ` / `hyp ` / `rej ` / `?   `)
- `short_id` left-padded to 4 chars (`G1  ` / `D17 ` / `Q3  `)
- `title` truncated to fit row width; tail-ellipsis with `…`
- `trailing_meta` only on hover; otherwise empty

Example row body (no indent, no connector):

```
● ▣ dec   D17   IR 用 Supabase + PostgreSQL 持久化
○ ◌ hyp   H3    solo founder 是最早付费人群
◐ ?  q    Q1    Tree 是否作为默认视图
⊘ ▣ dec   D5    用 Firebase 不用 Supabase            ← superseded, struck-through
```

### 2.3 Edge connector characters (between parent and child)

The connector char is placed **on the line that branches into the child**, between the indent guide and the child's status char.

| relation | char | reading | rendering color |
|---|---|---|---|
| `implies` | `►` | parent → child (parent导出子) | foreground |
| `depends_on` | `┊` | child depends on parent (子依赖父) | muted |
| `depends_on` *when parent.kind=`constraint`* | `━` | child constrained by parent | amber |
| `implies` *when parent.kind=`hypothesis`* | `◌` | parent hypothesizes child | purple |
| `resolves` | `‖` | child answers parent question | yellow |
| `refines` | `◇` | child refines parent | foreground-dim |
| `contradicts` | `↯` | child conflicts with parent | red |
| `supersedes` | — | **never rendered in tree** (lives in Detail's version chain) | — |

Important: the connector char specializes by `(relation, parent.kind)` for two cases (constraint and hypothesis), so users see "constrained by" and "hypothesizes" semantics without the data layer needing extra relation values. Data stays at 6 enum values; rendering disambiguates.

### 2.4 Indent guides

```
│   = vertical guide between siblings
├── = T-junction at a sibling that has more siblings below
└── = L-junction at the last sibling
```

These three characters compose the indent column. After the indent column ends, render the relation char, one space, then the row body. Indent step is 12px (CSS) but for ASCII reasoning each `│` / `├` / `└` is one column.

Example fragment:

```
● ◆ goal  G1    让判断得以积累
│
├──►  ● ▣ dec   D17   IR 用 Supabase + PostgreSQL
│     │
│     ├──┊  ● ▣ dec   D2    Supabase free tier 够用
│     └──┊  ○ ▣ dec   D8    Daily backup pipeline
│
├──◌  ○ ◌ hyp   H3    solo founder 是最早付费人群
│
└──‖  ● ▣ dec   D9    Tree 作为默认视图              ↑ resolves Q1
```

(Last row's `↑ resolves Q1` is the trailing_meta hover hint, normally hidden.)

---

## 3. Layout & density specs

```
row height            : 24px
indent step           : 12px (compresses to 8px after depth 4)
indent guide          : 1px solid rgba(foreground, 0.3)
font                  : 13px
  - status / kind glyph / code / short_id / connector : monospace (Geist Mono / JetBrains Mono)
  - title                                              : sans (Geist Sans)
hover row             : background rgba(foreground, 0.04)
selected row          : 2px left accent border, no background fill
                        (preserves tree structure visually)
trailing meta         : right-aligned, only on hover, 11px, muted
                        format: ↑{parents} ↓{children} · {age}
                        e.g. "↑2 ↓5 · 4d"
```

Width: the truth panel is fixed 360px in v1.2. v1.3 keeps that. At depth ≥ 4, indent compresses to 8px; at depth ≥ 6, the panel auto-scrolls horizontally rather than wrap (devs prefer over-flow over wrap).

Mobile (< 768px): tree mode disabled, falls back to Type mode.

## 4. DAG rendering rules

### 4.1 Choosing roots

**A node is a tree root iff it has no incoming relation edges.** This is the topological-root definition for a DAG. In practice:

- All `goal` IRs are typically roots (nothing implies a goal in V1)
- `principle` IRs are usually roots (free-floating rules)
- `constraint` IRs are usually roots (external limits)
- `hypothesis` IRs may or may not be roots, depending on whether something implies them
- Any IR with at least one incoming `implies`/`depends_on`/`refines`/`resolves` edge is **not** a root

`contradicts` edges do **not** affect root selection — they are bidirectional in spirit, and a contradicts-only node is still a root.

`supersedes` edges do **not** affect tree at all (they live in Detail's version chain, §6.3).

### 4.2 Choosing the primary parent for multi-parent IRs

When a node has multiple incoming non-`supersedes`/non-`contradicts` edges, exactly one of those edges' source nodes becomes the **primary parent**. The node is rendered **fully** under the primary parent; under all other parents, only a 1-line shadow row is rendered.

**Selection rule** (in order):

1. Edge with relation priority: `implies` > `depends_on` > `refines` > `resolves`
2. If tied: parent's `created_at` ascending (older parent wins — stable across re-renders)
3. If still tied: parent's id lexicographic ascending

The selection is computed client-side from the loaded edge set. **It is deterministic and stable** — the same data renders the same tree.

### 4.3 Shadow row format

Under non-primary parents, the multi-parent node renders as a single-line shadow:

```
{indent}{connector}  {status} {kind_glyph} {code} {short_id}   {title:short}    ↑{N}  (also under {primary_parent_short_id})
```

- The shadow row is 1 line, never expandable
- It does not render its own children — clicking it scrolls the tree to the primary location and opens that subtree
- `↑N` indicates total parent count (not just "other" parents — total)
- The "(also under X)" note is **always** the primary parent's short_id, not the other shadow contexts

Visually the shadow row is rendered at 60% opacity to distinguish from primary rows.

### 4.4 Cycle detection

The 6-relation enum + DB CHECK + UNIQUE constraint mostly prevent cycles, but `contradicts` and `refines` can form cycles in malformed data. Renderer must:

1. Track visited node ids during DFS
2. If a node appears again during traversal, render as a shadow with `(cycle)` annotation
3. Log a warning (not an error — don't break the tree on bad data)

---

## 5. Interactions

### 5.1 Mouse

| action | effect |
|---|---|
| click row | select node → Detail pane renders it; tree row gets accent border |
| click `kind_glyph` | toggle filter to that kind only; tree collapses to matching nodes + ancestors |
| click `code` text | same as click glyph (larger hit target) |
| click `short_id` | copy id to clipboard, toast "Copied D17" |
| click connector char | Detail pane shows that edge's metadata (relation, source/target, created_at, future: rationale) |
| click `↑N` shadow marker | popover lists all parents; click one to jump there |
| click `[⚙]` panel header | menu: Show superseded / Show dismissed / View mode (Tree/Type/Flat) |
| click `[⌕]` | inline search (§5.3) |
| hover row 1.2s | tooltip with `source_text_span` excerpt |
| double-click row | toggle expand/collapse for that subtree |

### 5.2 Keyboard

The truth panel is keyboard-navigable when focused. Vim-style bindings:

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `↓` | next visible row |
| `k` / `↑` | previous visible row |
| `h` / `←` | collapse current; if already collapsed, jump to parent |
| `l` / `→` | expand current; if already expanded, jump to first child |
| `gg` | jump to first root |
| `G` | jump to last visible row |
| `o` / `Enter` | open Detail (focus shifts to Detail) |
| `/` | focus inline search |
| `f` | toggle filter mode (then a kind char to filter, e.g. `fd` = decisions only) |
| `Esc` | clear filter / blur search |
| `[` / `]` | jump to previous / next root |

These bindings are active only when the truth panel itself has focus (click into it or `Tab` from elsewhere).

### 5.3 Inline search

Top-bar `[⌕]` opens an input that filters the tree in-place:

- Plain text → matches `id`, `title`, `content`, `rationale`
- `kind:dec` / `kind:goal` → kind filter
- `status:pending` / `status:idea` → status filter (status:superseded reveals the hidden ones)
- `topic:onboarding` → topic filter (V1.5)
- Multiple terms AND-joined

Filter behavior: the tree shows matching nodes **plus all their ancestors** (preserving structure). Non-matching ancestors render at 40% opacity to stay legible. Esc clears.

## 6. Detail pane relations area (overrides v1.2 §4 relations subsection)

When a node is selected, the Detail pane renders its IR content as before (per v1.2 §4) and adds a **Relations** block at the top with **4 collapsible sections**:

```
Relations
─────────
↓ Implies / Children (3)              ← outgoing implies / depends_on / refines / resolves
   ▣ D2  Supabase free tier 够用
   ▣ D8  Daily backup pipeline
   ◌ H3  solo founder 是最早付费人群

↑ Implied by / Parents (1)            ← incoming implies / depends_on / refines / resolves
   ◆ G1  让判断得以积累

‖ Co-resolved (1)                     ← siblings under same `resolves` target (i.e. competing answers to same question)
   ▣ D11 用 Supabase Tree (alternative answer)

↯ Conflicts (0)
   (none)
```

- Each section is a chip list. Each chip is `{kind_glyph} {short_id}  {title_truncated_40}`.
- Clicking a chip switches the selected node (tree highlight follows).
- Section auto-collapses when count = 0 (renders empty placeholder for "(none)").
- The full edge list (with `relation`, direction, created_at) is **NOT** in this block — it's in a separate `[All edges]` collapsible below for power users / debugging.

### 6.1 Why "Co-resolved" is its own section

If `Q1` is an open_question and both `D9` and `D11` have `resolves` edges to `Q1`, then `D9` and `D11` are **co-resolved siblings** — they both answer the same question. This is a relationship users care about when reviewing decisions ("what are the alternative answers we considered?") but is not a direct edge.

The renderer computes co-resolved nodes by: for the selected node N, find all `resolves` edges N→Q, then find all OTHER nodes with `resolves` edges to the same Q. Those are co-resolved siblings.

### 6.2 Why "Conflicts" is its own section

`contradicts` edges are bidirectional in spirit. Whether the edge is N→other or other→N, the user sees them in this section. The chip indicates direction with a small arrow if the user cares (`↯→` or `←↯`).

### 6.3 Version chain (supersedes) lives below Relations

Per v1.2 §4 Section 5 (Version history), `supersedes` edges form a linear-ish chain rendered separately. v1.3 keeps this. The chain renders as:

```
Version chain
─────────────
D5 (superseded 4d ago)  →  D17 (current)  →  ?
       ⊘                       ●
```

Each chain entry is clickable → switches selected node.

---

## 7. View modes

The `[⚙]` menu offers a view-mode toggle:

| mode | when to use | difference from Tree |
|---|---|---|
| **Tree** (default) | exploring relations, design review | DAG-rooted indent, edge glyphs, shadow rendering |
| **Type** (legacy) | quickly counting "how many decisions / constraints" | flat list per kind, no edges shown |
| **Flat** | post-search dumping, copy-paste workflows | one big monospace list sorted by `short_id`, no grouping |

User's choice persists per-project in `localStorage` (`zeno.truth.viewMode.<projectId>`).

In **Type** mode (legacy):
- Same row format as Tree (status / kind / code / short_id / title)
- No connectors, no indent
- Group headers: `▾ Decisions (8)` / `▸ Constraints (3)` / etc.
- Default expanded: `Decisions`, `Constraints`. Others collapsed (matches v1.2).

In **Flat** mode:
- One list, sortable column header click (id / title / kind / status / age)
- Filtered when search active
- Copy-row action in row context menu

---

## 8. Implementation hints for codex

### 8.1 Data shape needed at component boundary

```ts
type TruthTreeData = {
  nodes: Map<string, IRNode>;         // by short_id (e.g. "D17")
  edges: IREdge[];                     // already filtered to status='active'
  // computed lazily by the component:
  // - rootIds: string[]            (no incoming non-supersedes/contradicts edge)
  // - primaryParentOf: Map<string, string | null>
  // - childrenOf: Map<string, string[]>  (ordered by primary parent edge priority)
};
```

The truth panel currently fetches `IRNode[]` and `IREdge[]` separately via SWR. v1.3 needs both in the same render pass. Add a single `useTruthTreeData` hook that returns the structure above, recomputing on data change.

### 8.2 Performance

For projects with > 200 nodes, naive DFS is fine (microseconds). Don't pre-virtualize unless real perf data shows we need to. **react-window is overkill at v1 scale.**

### 8.3 Reusing existing components

- `ir-panel.tsx` should keep its top-bar (search / re-entry indicator / view mode toggle / `[⚙]`) unchanged
- The body (currently `TRUTH_GROUPS.map(...)`) should branch on view mode:
  - `tree` → new `<TruthTree nodes edges />`
  - `type` → existing flat-by-kind rendering (refactor into `<TruthByType nodes />`)
  - `flat` → new `<TruthFlat nodes />`
- Detail pane (`ir-panel.tsx` lines ~190-230) needs the 4-section refactor (§6 above)

### 8.4 Glyph rendering safety

All glyphs in §2 are BMP unicode and render in every modern browser font that supports CJK. **Test on Windows Chrome and macOS Safari at 13px** before merging — `▣` and `▮` are the most likely to look bad on Windows default fonts. If they do, swap to `■` and `▪` respectively.

### 8.5 Color tokens

Use the existing CSS vars `--ir-text-primary` / `--ir-text-secondary` / `--ir-text-tertiary` / `--ir-warning-fg` / etc. Add new ones if needed:

```css
--ir-glyph-goal: rgba(34,197,94, 0.85);      /* green-dim */
--ir-glyph-decision: rgba(59,130,246, 0.85); /* blue-dim */
--ir-glyph-constraint: rgba(245,158,11, 0.85); /* amber-dim */
--ir-glyph-principle: rgba(20,184,166, 0.85); /* teal-dim */
--ir-glyph-hypothesis: rgba(168,85,247, 0.85); /* purple-dim */
--ir-glyph-question: rgba(234,179,8, 0.85);   /* yellow-dim */
--ir-glyph-rejection: rgba(239,68,68, 0.85);  /* red-dim */
--ir-edge-contradicts: rgba(239,68,68, 1);    /* red */
```

These are dark-mode-first; light-mode tokens follow the same naming with adjusted opacity.

---

## 9. Open questions (mark TODO before implementation)

- [ ] **TODO-Sean**: confirm whether `unclassified` rows render in the tree at all, or get hidden by default. Spec leans toward "show with `?` glyph" but you may want them hidden until classified.
- [ ] **TODO-Sean**: keyboard binding for "promote idea → pending" inline (e.g. `p` on a selected idea row). Not in v1.3 unless you want it.
- [ ] **TODO-Sean**: should hovering an `↑N` marker preload the parent contexts (so the popover opens instantly), or load on click? Pre-loading uses bandwidth at panel open; on-click adds 100ms latency. Default is on-click — flag if you want pre-load.

---

## 10. Out of scope for v1.3

Explicitly **not** addressed by this spec:

- AI-suggested new edges (would need a "suggest" UI in Detail — defer to v1.5)
- Edge rationale field (would need DB column on `ir_edges` — defer to v1.5)
- Cross-topic relations (`topic_relations` table is implemented but UI is separate from truth tree)
- Drag-and-drop reorder
- Node deletion (only supersede + dismiss exist in V1)
- Bulk operations on multiple selected nodes
- Graph view (force-directed visualization) — explicitly rejected for v1, dev users prefer the tree
