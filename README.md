## What is ZENO?

ZENO is a workspace where you research a **project**, not a single question. You start from a vague idea; ZENO helps you break it into topics, investigate them, and keep the structure intact as your goal evolves — even when it ends up 180° from where you began.

Unlike single-shot research tools (Perplexity, Deep Research, plain AI chat), ZENO doesn't treat each question as stateless. It treats the **project** — its evolving topics, confirmed findings, open questions, and how they connect — as durable state. And nothing becomes project truth without your explicit confirmation.

---

## Why ZENO exists

When you start digging into something that matters — where to put your money, whether to move abroad, which direction to take your career — the question you end up needing to answer is almost never the one you started with.

"How do I get stable returns?" turns into currency and macro risk, turns into moving some assets abroad, turns into needing a second residency, turns into where you'd actually live and work. One vague worry branches into a dozen large topics that have little to do with where you began.

Today's tools lose this thread. Every question starts from zero; the structure of your own inquiry lives only in your head and a scatter of disconnected chats. ZENO is built for exactly this: a single project that catches a vague idea, follows it wherever it turns, researches each branch, and **accumulates what you've confirmed** — so you never re-derive it, and the thread never breaks no matter how far the goal moves.

---

## How it works

### 1. Work inside a project, not isolated questions
Each project holds multiple topics. Each topic hosts an ongoing conversation — the **Sandbox** — where you actually think, explore, and dig.

### 2. A vague idea becomes topics and open questions
You don't need a well-formed question to start. ZENO reads the conversation and surfaces the open questions and sub-topics hiding inside a fuzzy idea, so the project can branch as your thinking does. *(Automated kickoff decomposition — L1 — is in active development; today you structure topics yourself and ZENO seeds candidates from the conversation.)*

### 3. Investigate — and keep only what you confirm
Not every thought is worth keeping. ZENO uses a three-stage funnel (node statuses `idea` → `pending` → `active`):

- **Idea** — things ZENO noticed but isn't sure about yet. Quietly listed; no action required.
- **Candidate** — high-confidence findings waiting for your confirmation.
- **Truth** — what you've confirmed. The durable state of your project. Read-only afterward; changes go through supersede, not edit.

ZENO captures these from your conversation through several mechanisms (inline marker, "Explore new idea" sweep, and manual sweep are live; `/save` and periodic safety sweeps are planned). The principle is simple: **prefer to miss something than to make it up**. ZENO never auto-writes truth — every candidate requires your explicit confirmation.

### 4. The Truth Graph holds the whole evolving inquiry
The right panel renders your project as an interactive **graph canvas** (custom SVG + [ELK](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs) layout), not a flat list — so you can trace how a topic connects back to the question that spawned it, even after the goal has turned. Two scope modes: **All** (truths + candidates + ideas, with cross-stage edges) and **Truth** (confirmed only). Click any node — its rationale, source, relations, and actions open in a unified detail pane below the canvas. One place where details live: no modals, no nested panels.

### 5. Re-research on a schedule, not just once
Research can be a one-time pass or a standing task: ZENO is designed to re-check assumptions that depend on a moving world and report back when something you confirmed no longer holds. *(Scheduled re-verification — Watchtower / L3 — is on the near-term roadmap.)*

### 6. Future sessions inherit what you've confirmed
Every new conversation in the same project automatically receives the relevant confirmed truth as context. ZENO knows what you've decided, what you've ruled out, and why — without you pasting anything.

### 7. (For builders) Hand the same project to a coding agent
When an inquiry turns into something to build, ZENO's MCP server exposes the same confirmed project truth to coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) — **read tools** plus **write tools**, all **candidate-first and enforced server-side**: every MCP write lands as a candidate in your review queue and becomes truth only after you confirm it (Iron Law 4). This is downstream of the research — a secondary path, not the main event.

## Who ZENO is for

ZENO is for people running a **real, evolving inquiry** — something important enough to research properly and open-ended enough to change shape as you learn. Money, a possible move abroad, a career turn, a big purchase, a business idea, a research question. People who want to *think rigorously* about a fuzzy problem, not just get a quick answer.

It assumes:

- **You're working on something that mutates.** The goal you start with isn't the goal you'll end with — and you want a place that holds the whole journey, not a fresh chat each time.
- **You'll do the thinking.** ZENO researches, structures, and surfaces; you decide what's true. It rewards people who treat their own questions as worth investigating.
- **Your inquiry spans days or weeks, not one sitting.** A one-off question doesn't need ZENO.

**For builders:** if your project ends in something to build, the same confirmed project truth feeds coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) via MCP. That's a downstream path, not the reason ZENO exists.

## V1 scope

### Built today

- Project → topic → Sandbox conversation structure
- Three-stage funnel (Idea → Candidate → Truth) with explicit user confirmation
- Extraction: inline markers, "Explore new idea" sweep, manual sweep
- Truth Graph canvas (SVG + ELK) with **All** / **Truth** scope modes and a unified detail pane
- Inline references in chat — active truth (blue underline), pending candidate (blue dashed pill), superseded (gray strikethrough), all clickable
- Reactivation Anchor — load a past truth node back into the conversation as active context
- Git-style immutable history (supersede instead of edit)
- MCP server: read tools + `submit_candidate` + controlled decision/edge writes
- Automatic truth inheritance into every new conversation in a project
- Multi-provider model routing (Anthropic · Amazon Bedrock · OpenAI) with a thinking-depth control
- In-app localization (English · 中文 · Français)

### What V1 deliberately does not do

- No auto-writing to project truth — every entry requires user confirmation
- No execution and no write-side autonomy — read-only autonomous research is core (see Iron Law 0); executing code or tools is not
- No BYOK (bring your own key) — platform keys only
- No conversation import — projects start fresh in ZENO
- No general-purpose knowledge base — ZENO stores project judgment, not arbitrary notes
- No multi-user collaboration in V1 (single judgment owner; multi-user is V2)
- No mobile UI in V1 (desktop only; mobile in V1.5)

## Core concepts

### Truth Substrate
Project-level confirmed judgment that persists across sessions, AI agents, and tools. Not chat history. Not memory snippets. Structured nodes with a **kind** (`open_question` / `goal` / `constraint` / `plan` / `hypothesis` / `principle` / `rejection`), a status, relations, and rationale. Read-only after confirmation; modifications go through supersede.

### Sandbox
The chat container under each topic. Where actual thinking and exploration happens. A user can "Explore new idea" to clear the chat and trigger sweep extraction — declaring "I want to switch to a different idea." The cleared conversation is preserved server-side as immutable history; only the visual chat is reset.

### Truth Graph
The right-side interface where project judgment becomes inspectable: an interactive graph canvas (SVG + ELK layout) rather than a flat list. Nodes are laid out by their relations; a draggable detail pane below the canvas shows the selected node's rationale, source, and actions. Scope toggles between **All** (truths + candidates + ideas) and **Truth** (confirmed only).

### Reactivation Anchor
When you load a past truth node into the current conversation, ZENO sets it as the **active context anchor** — the AI knows you're refining or extending this specific judgment. New candidates extracted in that session default to a relation hint pointing at the anchor.

### Inline Reference
When AI generates a response and judges that the conversation just produced a clear truth-worthy judgment, it embeds a marker. The marker renders inline in chat as a clickable reference — blue underlined for active truth, blue dashed pill for pending candidate, gray strikethrough for superseded. Click → open in the detail pane.

### Core loop
**Sandbox conversation → Extraction → Idea / Candidate funnel → User confirmation → Truth → Inherited by future sessions and agents**

## What makes ZENO different

Most AI products are built around one of these units: a chat, a prompt, a document, or a memory snippet. Research tools are built around a single **question**.

ZENO is built around a larger unit:

### **The project**

A project is a living structure of topics, findings, open questions, and confirmed judgment — and the relations between them. It persists across sessions and agents, and it holds together even when the goal turns 180°. The question is what you search; the project is what you keep.

---

## What ZENO is NOT

- **Not a single-question research tool.** Perplexity, Deep Research, and plain AI chat answer one question at a time and forget the rest. ZENO holds the whole project and what you've confirmed.
- Not a general-purpose chatbot
- Not a tool aggregator or navigation hub
- Not a one-shot result generator
- Not a chat-history wrapper with "memory" branding
- Not a competitor to coding agents — ZENO can **feed** them, but that's downstream, not the point

---

## Design principles

ZENO follows one duty and four iron laws that guide every design decision:

- **Iron Law 0 — Proactive diligence.**
  ZENO must act on the project unprompted: decompose, research, verify, report. Its autonomy is always read-only — everything it produces enters the funnel as idea / candidate / evidence, never becomes truth on its own, and nothing is ever executed. Laws 1–4 are boundaries; when the duty conflicts with a boundary, the boundary wins.

- **Iron Law 1 — Never own the execution environment, only judgment.**
  ZENO does not run code, write files, or do automated tasks. It maintains decision truth. Coding agents do execution; ZENO supplies their context. This is a neutrality commitment — agents trust ZENO precisely because it never executes and never competes with them.

- **Iron Law 2 — Prefer to miss than to make up.**
  Trust-preserving recall beats maximum recall. A wrong truth poisons all downstream work; a missed truth can be added later.

- **Iron Law 3 — Don't store raw transcripts, casual preferences, or auto-generated plans as truth.**
  Truth is what the user explicitly confirms. The boundary between conversation and truth must be sharp.

- **Iron Law 4 — MCP write is candidate-first; truth is user-confirmed.**
  External coding agents propose new candidates via MCP; only the user promotes a candidate to truth.

Beyond the iron laws:

- **Automate investigation; confirm truth; ration confirmation** — investigation can be unlimited, but confirmation is a scarce resource: ZENO never auto-writes truth, and never converts investigation volume into confirmation-request volume.
- **Project state is the source of truth, not any single conversation.**
- **Build only what must be built — no unnecessary wheels.**

## Roadmap / not yet built

These are designed but **not implemented yet** — listed for context, not commitment. The active-research items below (**L1 Kickoff**, **L2 Research Brief**, **Watchtower / L3**) are now the primary build focus — they are what turns ZENO from a place that *holds* judgment into one that actively *produces* research.

| Item | Stage |
|---|---|
| `/save` select-to-save extraction | V1 |
| Periodic safety sweep (every N turns) | V1 |
| Agent-handoff blocking sweep before MCP read | V1 |
| Reactivation-anchor decay over turns | V1 |
| Credit-based pricing / billing | V1 |
| **L1 Kickoff** — intake interview + seeded topic decomposition on project creation | V1 |
| **L2 Research Brief** — "Research this" on a node → sourced evidence brief | V1.x |
| Multi-model `@mentions` (`@opus`, `@gpt54`) | V1.5+ |
| Mobile UI | V1.5 |
| **Watchtower (L3)** — scheduled re-verification of externally exposed assumptions | V1.5 |
| **Council (redefined)** — adversarial check on high-stakes candidates before confirmation | V1.5+ |
| **Multi-user collaboration** — team-level decision substrate | V2 |

---

## Status

🟢 **V1 — Private Beta (invite-only).** The project research loop is live behind invite codes: start from a vague idea → break it into topics → investigate → confirm what's true → hold it in the Truth Graph → inherit it in every future session. Current focus is hardening the research pipeline (source scoring, quote verification, provider resilience) based on beta usage.
